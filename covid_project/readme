#Project Description
This project uses BigQuery's public covid data (through Sep 2022) to compare national population, confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, and death rates. 
The idea is to see if a nation's population has any correlation with its  death rate (ie, if cramped conditions lead to more death). 
The analysis portion of this will be coming soon, this code is just pulling and cleaning the data (most notably, the most recent report for each country is different 
and there and numerous entries for some countires on the same day, some with only partial numbers, so the right date needed to be selected and excess reports removed)
